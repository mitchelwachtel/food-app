# Gourmet-Guru
(not finished)
### 1.Description: 
Gourmet guru helps any food lover keep track of all their favorite restaurants, their favorite dishes at those restaurants and gives a rough estimate of the calories of the dish. It stores the user inputs into local storage and creats elements in the HTML via JS. Each new card containing the user input data has a delete button function to delete that particular item from storage. 
<br>
Upon submission, a modal is displayed that allows for the user to travel to their logged entries or stay where they are and input another entry. There are also buttons at the top of the page that also move the user to their stored logs or the input section. We used foursquare server-side API to fetch most of the data about the searched restaurant and we used spoonify server-side API to get the estimated caloric value of the user input.
<br>
We also attached validations to the user input fields that will let the user know when something invalid has been entered. An interactive 5-star rating was added using font-awesome We have a clean and catching UI/design from everything on the page to the modal that appears to create a freidnly and inviting user experience.
